The AI engineer's work encompassed substantial feature development and UI/UX refinements for the Hackathon Tinder application, evolving it from MVP. Initial efforts focused on verifying existing UI components (photo heights) and backend data (). A significant portion of the trajectory involved debugging login/onboarding flow and populating the database via direct API calls due to session persistence issues. Core enhancements included extensive dummy data improvements, comprehensive profile editing (social links, experience, projects, custom skills/interests), clickable user profiles in chat, and an expanded overview dashboard. The most iterative and challenging part involved implementing a Tinder-like stacked card UI with advanced swipe animations, next card peek, and an undo feature across People, Hackathons, and Projects sections, alongside branding changes to HackSwipe. Despite multiple attempts and user feedback cycles, the animation logic for swiping and undo, and the precise visual nuances of the stacked cards, remained an ongoing challenge, leading to the current state where the AI is debugging the swipe animation.

<product_requirements>
The Hackathon Tinder web app aims to connect individuals with hackathons, projects, and other people using a swipe-to-match mechanism, real-time 1:1 and group DMs, and comprehensive profile/post management. Key features include Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI for frontend, Next.js API routes with MongoDB for backend, NextAuth for authentication, and Socket.IO for real-time features. The app includes Explore (People, Hackathons, Projects with posting/swiping), Matches (direct and post-wise inquiries), real-time DMs, an Overview dashboard with stats, and editable user profiles. The application currently has working authentication, a multi-step profile wizard, a 3-tab explore system, real-time messaging, and an enhanced overview dashboard. Recent work involved advanced UI/UX for explore cards, introducing HackSwipe branding, multi-card stacking, next card peek, and undo functionality.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a Next.js App Router structure, integrating frontend and backend logic.



-   **/app/app/api/[[...path]]/route.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Unified backend API for authentication, profiles, posts, swipes, matches, conversations, and dummy data generation.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensively modified to:
        -   Enhance dummy data for users, profiles, hackathons, and projects (realistic names, descriptions, experiences, social links).
        -   Includes endpoints for CRUD operations related to profile editing and post management.
        -   Email references in dummy data were systematically updated to match new user profiles.

-   **/app/app/page.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Main client-side UI, managing global state, navigation, auth, profile creation, explore, matches, overview, and messaging.
    -   **Changes Made**: Heavily modified and expanded to:
        -   Implement profile editing dialog with support for social links, work experience, multiple projects, and custom skills/interests.
        -   Add Edit Profile button to the profile section.
        -   Make user icons in chat conversations and messages clickable to view profiles.
        -   Enhance the matches section (clickable profiles, working message button, inquiries).
        -   Expand the overview dashboard with Hackathons Joined and Projects Joined statistics.
        -   Implement advanced stacked card UI for People, Hackathons, and Projects with 3-card stack, next card peek, and undo functionality (using Framer Motion for animations).
        -   Change app branding to HackSwipe with tagline Swipe. Match. Build. on the login/main page.
        -   Underwent numerous iterations for visual adjustments of stacked cards and animations.

-   **/app/app/layout.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Defines the root layout, global styling, and fonts.
    -   **Changes Made**: Mentioned as modified for providers but no specific changes detailed in trajectory.

-   **/app/package.json**:
    -   **Summary**: Lists project dependencies.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated for NextAuth, Socket.IO client, and UI libraries (e.g., framer-motion implied by usage).

<pending_tasks>
-   Ensure Create your first post button redirects correctly.
-   Fix animation of current card going right and preview card coming in when swiping.
-   Add discover more or similar message when no more cards are left in explore sections.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on refining the interactive elements of the explore sections, specifically focusing on the swipe animations and the undo functionality. The user explicitly stated that no card animation is working for both rejecting (card going left) and undoing (card coming back left-to-right), and also highlighted issues with the general card transitions (current card animating out, next card sliding in). The AI engineer had just completed re-positioning the undo button to be next to the reject ('X') button and removed its previous standalone placement. It also made initial attempts to fix the reject animation and ensure background cards slide forward. The current action involves finding the  function to debug and correct the animation logic for the swiping mechanism and card transitions across the People, Hackathons, and Projects explore tabs. The app also has an HackSwipe branding with Swipe. Match. Build. tagline.
