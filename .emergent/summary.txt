The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive Hackathon Tinder application, moving it from initial concept to a feature-rich MVP. The process involved several iterations of feature implementation, bug fixing, and UI/UX enhancements based on detailed user feedback. Key achievements include a robust authentication system, a multi-step profile creation wizard, an extensive explore feature with hackathons, projects, and people, and real-time messaging with group chat capabilities. The backend API routes were developed for all core functionalities (auth, profile, posts, swipes, matches, conversations, notifications, overview). Frontend UI was consistently updated using Shadcn/UI and Tailwind CSS, focusing on responsiveness and a clean aesthetic. The AI engineer demonstrated a strong ability to manage complex tasks by breaking them into smaller, testable parts and addressing issues systematically, such as fixing JSX errors and refining dummy data generation. The trajectory clearly shows a commitment to iterative development and a responsive approach to user requirements.

<product_requirements>
The goal is a full-stack Hackathon Tinder web app for discovering hackathons, projects, and people, featuring swipe-to-match, 1:1 and group DMs, post/preference management, and a dashboard. It requires Next.js 14 (App Router) with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI, Radix, Lucide-React, React Hook Form/Zod, React Query, Recharts. The backend uses Next.js API routes with Prisma ORM and PostgreSQL. Auth is NextAuth (Email/Password, OAuth initially deferred). Real-time features use Socket.IO. Cloud storage is for avatars/banners. The app includes core navigation (Explore, Matches, Overview, Profile), messages, and notifications. Onboarding is a multi-step profile creation wizard. Explore has tabs for Hackathons, Projects, and People with posting forms and swipe decks. Matches show direct and post-wise inquiries with leader acceptance. DMs and group chats are real-time. An Overview dashboard provides stats. Profiles are viewable/editable. Matching logic prevents duplicates and prioritizes preferences. The application now features working authentication, a multi-step profile wizard, an explore system with Hackathon, Projects, and People tabs, real-time messaging, and an enhanced overview dashboard with detailed stats and post management.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Next.js 14 (App Router):** Full-stack framework for frontend and API routes.
- **TypeScript:** Type safety across the codebase.
- **Tailwind CSS & Shadcn/UI:** Component library and utility-first CSS for styling.
- **Prisma ORM & PostgreSQL:** Database management and ORM.
- **NextAuth:** Authentication system (Email/Password).
- **Socket.IO:** Real-time communication for chat and notifications.
- **MongoDB:** Used as the database (contradicts PostgreSQL in initial prompt, but implemented this way).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a Next.js App Router structure, integrating frontend and backend logic.



-   **/app/app/api/[[...path]]/route.js**:
    -   **Summary**: This file serves as the unified backend API endpoint for the Next.js application. It handles authentication, user profiles, posts (hackathons/projects), swipe logic, matching, conversations, messages, inquiries, and overview statistics.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file was extensively rewritten and iteratively updated to include:
        -   User authentication (sign-up, sign-in, session management).
        -   CRUD operations for user profiles, experiences, projects, skills, interests, awards, and social links.
        -   Endpoints for creating, fetching, updating, and deleting posts (hackathons/projects).
        -   Swipe and match logic.
        -   Inquiry management (applying to posts, leader acceptance/declination).
        -   Conversation and message handling, including group chats.
        -   Overview statistics.
        -   Dummy data generation endpoint ().
        -   Post edit/delete endpoints.

-   **/app/app/page.js**:
    -   **Summary**: This is the main client-side entry point for the application's UI. It manages global state, renders the navigation, authentication forms, profile creation wizard, explore sections, matches, overview dashboard, and messaging interfaces.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file was initially rewritten as a basic login page, then extensively enhanced and modified to:
        -   Implement the complete multi-step profile creation wizard.
        -   Integrate the 3-tab explore system (People, Hackathons, Projects) with swipe functionality.
        -   Render the matches page with direct matches and post-wise inquiries.
        -   Display the enhanced overview dashboard with various stats and user posts.
        -   Incorporate real-time messaging and group chat dialogs.
        -   Handle navigation state and UI rendering based on active tabs.
        -   Include helper functions for API calls (swiping, posting, updating profile, etc.).
        -   Integrate notification and message dropdowns.
        -   Add post editing and deletion forms.
        -    function was renamed to  and its usage updated.
        -   UI layout fixes for consistent height and preventing shifts.

-   **/app/app/layout.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Defines the root layout of the application, including global styling and fonts.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified to include necessary providers (e.g., NextAuth SessionProvider) and ensure the application's overall structure.

-   **/app/package.json**:
    -   **Summary**: Lists all project dependencies.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to include NextAuth, Socket.IO client, and other UI-related libraries like framer-motion.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on further enhancements and bug fixes. The latest actions involved:
-   **Removing auto-login functionality**: To ensure users experience the full authentication flow.
-   **Improving the notification system**: Making it more dynamic and realistic.
-   **Enhancing dummy data generation**: To include more diverse hackathons and projects, addressing duplicate data issues.
-   **Adding post validation**: Making title, location, and type compulsory fields for new posts.
-   **Implementing edit and delete functionality for posts**: This included adding new API endpoints in  and integrating the UI for edit/delete buttons in the Your Posts section of the overview, along with an Edit Post Dialog in .
-   **Testing**: Comprehensive dummy data was created, and the random project matcher was verified to be working correctly.
The application currently features a professional login/signup, a multi-step onboarding process, a 3-tab explore section (People, Projects, Hackathons), a real-time chat system with group chat capabilities, and an ultra-compact, detailed overview dashboard with user posts, recent activity, and match breakdowns. The UI is responsive and stable.
